          <p>Model factories turbo-boosts the process by eliminating the need for passing multiple arrays for multiple records. You define an array of model attributes once in the factory class with fake value using a faker library. Then you generate the N number of records by just passing N as a parameter when calling the factory() method. Besides that, you can create data for related models using factories that were not possible with the seeders.</p>
